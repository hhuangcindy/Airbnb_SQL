## Introduction
Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present a more unique and personalized way of experiencing the world. Airbnb has become one of the world’s largest marketplace for travelers to find suitable, reliable places to stay and things to do. Since Airbnb’s opening, they offered over 7 million accommodations and 50,000 unique activities, all powered through local entrepreneurs and hosts.
We are interested in becoming a host for Airbnb in New York City. Our goal is to analyze which neighborhood group in New York City is a good place to start our business at. Furthermore, we want to have some insight on how the demand and price of Airbnb listings change over time to decide which months and price point would be the most suitable.
## Dataset Description
To analyze which neighborhood group in New York City would be the best place to post our listing on Airbnb, we have a dataset that describes the listing activity in New York City for 2019 and 2020 which were taken from [kaggle.com]. These two datasets have all the information about hosts, listings, and geographical availability for us to draw specific conclusions on our analysis.
